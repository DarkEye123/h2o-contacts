# h2o-contacts

H2O.ai UI Engineering Coding Challenge

## Goal

The goal is to build a functionally reduced version of Appleâ€™s OS X Contacts application that
runs in a browser.

## Expected features and notes

- A user should be able to view, edit, and create new contacts.
- As contacts are added to the application, they should appear in a list on the left pane of
  the user interface.
- A backend application and datastore is not required. Everything can be contained within
  the browser, and losing state by refreshing the browser is OK.
- Initial contact data can be hard-coded into the app.
- The user interface should match the user interface mockups provided.
- You can choose to implement a subset of the functionality as long as what's
  implemented works correctly and looks complete.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Brevity: write less code!
- Fidelity: how closely can you match the visual styling of the supplied interfaces

Use any framework (React / Knockout / Ember / Angular / etc.) to get your job done. Typescript
(or a statically typed language like Elm or ReasonML) is preferred.
